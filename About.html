                <h3>About Me!</h3>
                <p>I would describe myself as hardworking and self-disciplined. When it comes to something that I really want, I give my best effort in staying comitted, working hard, and much more. My virtues revolve around making the most of my opportunities and doing what I can to make myself the best person I can be. The idea of hardwork may be discouraging, but regardless it is a necessary step towards achieving your goals.</p>
                <p>"The willingness to put in that hard work is what separates winners and losers."</p>
